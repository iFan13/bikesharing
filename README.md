# Des Moines Bike Share Proposal

## Overview

This repository contains analysis and supporting images for potential a bike-sharing program proposal situated in Des Moines, Iowa. The results and analysis suggests a bike-sharing program is a solid business proposal. 

## Resources

Tableau Public domain is a tool used for this analysis. New York City's CitiBike program is used as a reference program, particularly for the month of August 2019 with data coming directly from CitiBike's system data (found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip)). The data is presented in vizualizations hosted by Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ian.fan#!/vizhome/NYCCitiBike_DesMoinesRef/NYCCitiBike).

## Results

The city of Des Moines, Iowa is a prime candidate for a bike sharing program. The success of New York City's CitiBike program can be used as a reference to compare and contrast how a bike sharing program could be successful. Let's first look at the user type. In New York City, user data is gathered and recorded with respects to whether the user is a per use-of-service customer or a service subscriber. A vast majority, (over 75%) are service subscribers as seen in the story page below.

We can further see the popular days of the week that these services are used. For subscribers, the service is used constantly and with very similar intensity where as per-use customers tend to lean more towards the week end days of Saturday and Sunday for most usage. This implies the customer userbase could be non local traffic such as tourists. We can otherwise make the assumption that the program would still be able to be successful even for a 'local only' model and this is in consideration to NYC being a city visited very highly in the United States. We can also see from the above story page that the male portion of the users have greater frequency in using the bike sharing service. 

We are able to chart users ages as well by birth year.

In this page, it is reflected once again that the male users are a majority of users for the service. However, we can also estimate the majority age of the users. Based on this graph, we can deduce that the users of the CitiBike Service are mostly born in 1980 to 1995 approximately (Ages 25-40). We can use this information and compare the population pyramids of New York City and Des Moines (sourced from [https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population) and [https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/des-moines-ia-population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/des-moines-ia-population)
)

Des Moines's median population is lower than NYC's population and has a 2% increase in male ratio. These both suggest that a bike sharing program can have success in Des Moines.

Ride duration is also a factor in potential success. If the distance needed to be covered is greater, there would be less incentive to walk and more incentive to use transportation methods such as vehicles or bicycles. Let's look at NYC's ride duration.

New York City is a densely populated city and is also dense in infrastructure. As such the use of vehicles is not ideal simply due to the volume of traffic. Furthermore, due to how closely packed the infrastructure is, it garners a greater potential to walk to one's destination. However, even given that statement, we can see from the records that people are using the bike sharing system and a large portion of that is for very short durations. Comparatively, Des Moines is less densly populated but is more spread apart making the appeal of using a mode of transportation more appealing. An implementation of a bike share system in Des Moines would likely have longer duration rides but would still be a faster alternative than walking then.

Des Moines as a city also favours sustainability as proven by various initiatives taken on by the city (for example: [clean energy commitment](https://www.dsm.city/news_detail_T2_R320.php#:~:text=A%20new%20resolution%20passed%20unanimously,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by%202050.)). Having a bike share program available would be in line with reducing emissions initiative. Trips durations being so short for NYC implies that even for Des Moines whose urban infrastructure is less dense, bicycling would be a reasonable mode of transportation.  

Finally, it's also worth noting how the bike share program is used. In New York City, we've tabulated start times of the trips recorded and further broken it down by gender.

![Service Usage](/Resources/StoryPg4.PNG)

We can see from this page that the largest volume of bike usage is circling 7-9am and 4-6pm. These line up with standard office hours and implies that in NYC, users of the bike share system are using it as a method of daily commute. This is a very good sign as it implies that implementing a bike share system for Des Moines could also be used for daily commute purposes.
